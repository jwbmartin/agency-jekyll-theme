description: Created for The Adler Planetarium | Far Horizon's Earth imaging Cubesat intiative. The identity for NITEsat (Night Imaging & Tracking Experiment Satellite) drew inspiration from technology and aerial photography. It looks geographical and of-this-earth, as well as space-age and futuristic. It represents both the Cubesat, and what the Cubesat will be looking down upon.<p><p style="color:#95a5a6;"><i> Collaborative work <a href="http://wewantto.design">We Want To __</a> / <a href="http://cbgworks.com/">Christopher Givens</i></a></p>
