description: Many businesses have unwanted hardware, like old desktop computers and tablets, that are often discarded and thrown away into our landfills. Meanwhile, many Chicago Public Schoolsâ€™ students are falling behind in STEM studies because they lack access to technology. CPU to EDU is a resource that allows businesses to donate their unwanted materials to Chicago students in need. <p> Haphazardly thrown together during cleverbridge's 5 hour <a href="www.https://hacktothefuture.splashthat.com/">Hack to the Future Hackathon</a>, our goal was to provide the resources to help students extend learning in the classroom and beyond.</p> <p> <a href="https://cputoedu.herokuapp.com/">See the live site here</a>
