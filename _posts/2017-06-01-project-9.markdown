description: An identity and ecommerce landing page for the alternative, independent publishing house, Zealous Press. While I am used to getting words such as "bold" or "quality" when I ask clients to define their company, I wasn't prepared for anything like "absurd" or "pataphysical" as brand characteristics. So, I wanted to create an identity that would flip your perceptions and be something that you could feel (or maybe even smell), and would embody Zealous Press goal to be a publishing house that embraces eclectic and eccentric stories.
