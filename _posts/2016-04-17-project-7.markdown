description: My role for this project with Vivint was designing and concepting the mobile-first UI for Vivint's first ecommerce and product experience. Within both mobile experience (iOS/Android) and web platforms, I led design in thinking of a significant portion of the UI and worked directly with cross-functional and development teams. <p><p style="color:#95a5a6;"><i>More samples of UI design for Vivint is available upon request.</i></a></p>
