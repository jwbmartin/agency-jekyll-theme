description: Only a small fraction of all natural history specimen data is available digitally, while the vast majority remains locked away from view and use. The Notes from Nature transcription project is a citizen science platform built to address this problem by helping to digitize the worldâ€™s biological collections. The redesign of notesfromnature.org was created with easy calls to action and a renewed focus on connecting the people behind the research with the community.
