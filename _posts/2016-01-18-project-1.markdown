description: Canopy Cannabis Co. started with a few core elements, a spirit of hard-work and a passion, with an unyielding attention to hand hewn details. It pays homage to the overarching love and labor that goes into making a top quality product. The overall tone of Canopy Cannabis Co. is conversational, straightforward, and honest with a strong desire to focus on what people need. It is open-minded but not empty-headed. Canopy Cannabis Co. is old school but not high school.
